##Business Idea:
My goal is to create an e-commerce platform where I can easily sell my own products. Additionally, my second target is to allow others to sell their products on my platform with ease. This will increase the usability and popularity of my platform.

##Product/Service Details:
The products on my platform will cater to people's needs, such as shirts, jeans, t-shirts, shorts, as well as categories for women and children. There will also be some jewelry items available.

##Revenue Model:
I believe that making money requires initial investment and patience. Success does not come immediately after starting a business. How you earn depends on your strategy and approach. If one effort fails, you need to be ready for the next one. Thatâ€™s it.

##Marketing Strategy:
According to my thinking, the best way to launch a product in the market is through advertising. However, as advertising requires funds, my solution is to create accounts on various platforms and advertise my products there. This method is simple and does not require any major investment.

##Team Details:
There will be other members working with me on this project. Together, we will create a platform that, God willing, will be able to compete with established e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Daraz.

##Future Goals:
My future goal is to rival leading e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Daraz.
